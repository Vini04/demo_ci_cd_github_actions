# CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Netlify

This project demonstrates a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **Netlify**.  
On every push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions automatically runs build steps and deploys the latest code to Netlify, making the app continuously integrated and deployed.
